# Example seccomp syscall whitelist (one syscall name per non-empty line)
# Lines starting with '#' are ignored.
# Use the minimal set required for your scripts to run. Avoid adding 'execve', 'ptrace',
# and other potentially dangerous syscalls unless absolutely necessary.
#
# Minimal example (I/O, memory management, basic process lifecycle):
read
write
open
close
mmap
munmap
brk
exit
exit_group
rt_sigaction
rt_sigprocmask
clock_gettime
getpid
getuid
getgid
futex
poll
epoll_wait

# Networking syscalls (add only if needed by your scripts):
# socket
# connect
# sendto
# recvfrom
